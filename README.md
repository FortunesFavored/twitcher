# THIS IS A PREVIEW ITS NOT COMPLETE YET WIP

## See also:
Uses a modified version of [MagicDumps](https://github.com/erodozer/magick-dumps)
but has the same limitations. Changed the library to use SpriteFrames instead of AnimatedTextures

## Image Transformer
TODO:
- Add info about custom image transformer
- Add info about send_message_delay (## Time to wait in msec after each sent chat message. Values below ~310 might lead to a disconnect after 100 messages.)

- Add other authentication flows too
