## A list of reports. The reports are returned in no particular order; however, the data within each report is in ascending order by date (newest first). The report contains one row of data per day of the reporting window; the report contains rows for only those days that the game was used. A report is available only if the game was broadcast for at least 5 hours over the reporting period. The array is empty if there are no reports.
